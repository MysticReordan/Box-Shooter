# Box-Shooter
A basic 3D game, built on Unity 3D and scripted in C#, Box Shooter primarily comprises two levels with a user-friendly UI and is developed as part of a Coursera course conducted by Michigan State University.

The coding of the scripts in this project was done in C# language on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, aided by the Unity Scripting Reference as well as the Microsoft Azure .NET Coding  Reference.  The game is built on the Unity 3D platform developed by Unity Technologies and employs shooting and subsequent destruction of coloured cubes in the game scene. It uses a typical FPS shooter perspective and adds perks to the rotation and movement of random cubes in the air with a random generation algorithm. Different score and health algorithms are attached to each coloured box as well as an attractive UI.
